# J-Lua
The source code to my programming Language, JLua
# Intro
JLua, Surprisingly was not made in Lua, But In JSON, To store all data and keywords. I may code the JLua Kernel In Python Or One Of The C languages.
I made this for my game, so you could make your own mods (Game is not out yet), Not to make any money or such.
JLua is very close to Lua and GLua. (GLua being the inspiration for the name)
# Features

For now, You can do the following things with J-Lua:

•Check Condition (If, else)

•Make functions

•Set variables

•Booleans

•Dictionaries
